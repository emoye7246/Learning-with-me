🎯 Core Philosophy

Every lesson must help the learner:

Build a Mental Model

Understand the Why

Grasp the Mechanics

Feel Progress

Even without projects, each article must unlock clarity.

We are not teaching syntax.
We are teaching understanding.

🧠 The Standard Lesson Structure

Every article must follow this exact structure.

1️⃣ Hook (Curiosity Activation)

Open with a short, engaging statement or question.

Purpose:

Spark interest

Connect to something familiar

Frame the concept in a real-world way

Example:

How does a program remember your name?

Keep this section short — 2–4 sentences max.

2️⃣ Why It Matters (Purpose Layer)

Explain:

Why this concept exists

What problem it solves

Where it appears in real programs

This prevents passive learning.

Learners must understand:

“If I didn’t know this, what would I be unable to do?”

Keep it concise but meaningful.

3️⃣ Core Concept (Clear Explanation)

Define the concept simply.

Structure:

Simple explanation

Slightly deeper explanation

Optional analogy

Avoid:

Overloading with theory

Introducing unrelated concepts

This is clarity, not density.

4️⃣ Syntax & Mechanics

Show the actual structure in Python.

Include:

Clean, minimal examples

Proper formatting

No unnecessary complexity

Example:

name = "Elijah"
print(name)

Explain:

What each part does

What Python is doing behind the scenes

How execution flows

This section builds precision.

5️⃣ Step-by-Step Breakdown

Walk through execution clearly.

Explain:

What runs first

What is stored

What is output

What changes in memory

This builds internal simulation skills.

The learner should be able to mentally trace the code.

6️⃣ Micro Reinforcement Prompt

Include 1–3 quick thinking prompts:

Examples:

What do you think this prints?

What happens if we change this value?

What if we remove this line?

This keeps engagement active.

Do NOT turn it into a full exercise.
Just stimulate thinking.

7️⃣ Mental Model Recap

End every article with:

What we learned

What this concept enables

How it connects to the next topic

Example:

Variables allow programs to store information.
Next, we’ll learn how to make decisions using that stored data.

This builds curriculum cohesion.

🧱 Tone & Voice Guidelines

The instructor voice must be:

Calm

Confident

Clear

Encouraging

Never condescending

Never overly academic

We teach like builders, not professors.

Avoid:

“As you can clearly see…”

“Obviously…”

Long textbook paragraphs

Prefer:

Short paragraphs

Clean spacing

Direct explanation

📐 Structural Rules

Every article must:

Stay focused on one main concept

Avoid introducing future lessons prematurely

Use consistent formatting

Include code blocks when relevant

End with a forward connection

No exceptions.

📚 Course-Level Cohesion

Articles within a course should follow logical progression:

Foundations

Flow & Control

Structure & Organization

Applied Logic

Systems Thinking

Each article must:

Reference prior knowledge naturally

Prepare for the next concept

The curriculum must feel like climbing stairs, not jumping platforms.

🔁 Consistency Rule

Before publishing any article, verify:

Does it follow the 7-section structure?

Does it build a mental model?

Is the explanation clear before showing complexity?

Does it feel aligned with the Skye teaching voice?

If not, revise.
