# Skye Learning Platform — MASTER STYLE GUIDE

This document defines how ALL lessons and projects are written.

It applies to:
- Every course
- Every lesson
- Every mini-project
- Every full project
- Every support object

Course-specific addendums may adjust tone slightly,
but this document is the foundation.

# 1. Core Philosophy

We do not teach syntax.

We teach thinking.

Students should leave each lesson feeling:

- More confident
- More clear
- More capable
- Less reactive

We do not overwhelm.
We do not over-explain.
We do not dump information.

We guide.

---

# 2. Tone & Voice

All content must be:

- Calm
- Clear
- Direct
- Confident
- Minimal fluff
- No hype
- No emojis
- No AI references

Use short paragraphs.

Use whitespace intentionally.

Speak directly to the learner using “you”.

Never sound robotic.
Never sound corporate.
Never sound overly motivational.

Confidence should come from clarity.

---

# 3. Lesson Structure (Required)

Every lesson must follow this structure:

## 1. Title

Clear. Specific. No clever wording.

## 2. Introduction

- What this concept is
- Why it matters
- How it fits into bigger understanding

Keep this short.

## 3. Mental Model

Explain the idea conceptually.

Use plain language.

Avoid technical overload.

If possible, relate to:
- flow
- state
- structure
- behavior

## 4. Focused Code Examples (2–4 max)

Rules:
- Small
- Clean
- Demonstrate one idea at a time
- No large programs
- No unnecessary complexity

Code is used to clarify thinking — not impress.

## 5. Common Mistakes

Brief bullet list.

Highlight beginner traps.

This builds debugging awareness.

## 6. Practice Prompts

- Small exercises
- No full solutions
- Hints only
- Encourage experimentation

## 7. Reflection Questions

Force the learner to think before moving on.

Example:
- What changes when X changes?
- Why does this loop stop?
- What would break if you removed Y?

## 8. What You Can Now Do

Reinforce skill gained.

Make growth visible.

## 9. Next Lesson Teaser

Short and forward-moving.

---

# 4. Project Structure (Required)

Projects simulate real software.

They must include:

## 1. Overview

Clear description of what the tool does.

## 2. Functional Requirements

Checklist of required behaviors.

## 3. User Flow

Step-by-step description of how a user interacts with the program.

## 4. Suggested File Structure (if applicable)

Example:
main.py  
utils.py  
data.py  

Even simple programs benefit from structure.

## 5. Implementation Milestones

Build in phases.

Encourage iteration.

## 6. Testing Checklist

Specific behavioral tests.

Not vague instructions.

## 7. Extensions

Optional upgrades.

Encourage deeper thinking.

---

# 5. Support System Standard

Every project must include structured support.

Support must follow this format:

- intro
- level1Nudges (thinking prompts)
- level2Hints (clearer guidance)
- blueprint (pseudocode steps)
- debuggingGuide
- revealSolutionWarning
- exampleSolution
- upgrades (blueprints only)

Important:

The article never gives the solution.

Support contains the example.

Solutions must be framed as:

"One possible implementation."

Never imply a single correct approach.

---

# 6. Code Standards

All code must be:

- Readable
- Explicit
- Beginner-safe
- No clever tricks
- No advanced features unless taught

Avoid:
- Lambdas (unless lesson is about them)
- One-line compressions
- Dense expressions

Clarity > brevity.

---

# 7. Formatting Rules

- Use Markdown headings (`##`, `###`)
- Keep paragraphs 1–3 lines max
- Avoid giant text blocks
- Code blocks must be small
- Avoid deeply nested formatting

Whitespace is part of the design.

---

# 8. Growth Alignment

Every lesson or project must strengthen at least one of:

- Debug without panic
- Reason about code behavior
- Handle ambiguity
- Think before typing
- Build usable software
- Structure before coding

This alignment should be subtle.

Never list it explicitly inside lessons.

---

# 9. What This Platform Is NOT

- Not a YouTube transcript
- Not a documentation dump
- Not a hype-driven bootcamp
- Not copy-and-paste training

It is structured skill development.

---

# 10. Naming Conventions

Lesson file:
lesson-<slug>.js  
Export: lesson<PascalCase>

Project file:
mini-project-<slug>.js  
Export: miniProject<PascalCase>

IDs must match slug exactly.

---

# 11. Codex Compliance Rules

When generating content via Codex, also follow the **Agent Course Authoring Guide** in this folder for concrete voice, phrasing, and structure patterns drawn from the gold-standard lessons.

- Follow this style guide strictly
- Do not invent new structure
- Do not alter tone
- Do not remove required sections
- Do not insert AI mentions

Consistency builds trust.
