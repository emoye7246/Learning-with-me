# Course 4 — Style Guide Addendum
Console Applications (Real Software, No Frameworks)

## Course Theme

This course moves from small scripts to real programs.

Students are no longer writing exercises.

They are building tools.

The tone should reflect that shift.

Less “you’re learning”.
More “you’re building”.

---

## Tone Adjustment (Important)

Still calm and clear.

But slightly more professional.

Less hand-holding.

More:

- Think like a developer
- Structure before typing
- Build intentionally

Avoid overly motivational language.
Confidence should come from structure.

---

## Structure Requirements (Lessons)

Each lesson must include:

1. Concept Introduction
2. Why This Matters in Real Software
3. Example (small but practical)
4. Common Mistakes in CLI Programs
5. Design Thinking Section
6. Implementation Checklist
7. “What This Enables” section

Console applications should feel purposeful.

---

## Project Structure Requirements

All projects in Course 4 must include:

### 1. Overview
What the tool does.

### 2. Functional Requirements
Clear checklist of behaviors.

### 3. User Flow Description
Step-by-step description of how a user interacts with the program.

### 4. Suggested File Structure (if multi-file)
Even if simple.

Example:
main.py
utils.py
data.py

### 5. Implementation Milestones
Build in phases.

### 6. Testing Checklist

### 7. Optional Extensions

## Code Example Rules

- Realistic
- No fake “toy” examples
- Show file separation when appropriate
- Show __name__ == "__main__" when discussing entry points
- Demonstrate clean input validation

Avoid:
- 200-line dumps
- Complex advanced Python features not yet taught

---

## Project Philosophy

Projects are no longer “mini”.

They simulate real tools.

The student should feel:

“I could actually use this.”

---

## Outcome Alignment

Each lesson or project must support:

- Build real, usable software
- Understand program flow deeply
- Gain confidence without UI complexity

These outcomes should be subtle but present.

---

## Voice Reminder

You are guiding a developer
who now understands basics.

Treat them as capable.

Push them toward structure.
