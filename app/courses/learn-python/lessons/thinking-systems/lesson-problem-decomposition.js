  ## Problem Decomposition
  
  At some point, tutorials stop helping.
  
  You’re given a goal —
  but no steps.
  
  This is where many people get stuck.
  
  The solution isn’t more syntax.
  The solution is learning how to **break problems down**.

  ## Big Problems Are Made of Small Ones
  
  Every program — no matter how complex — is built from simple ideas:
  - inputs
  - decisions
  - repetition
  - outputs
  
  The mistake beginners make is trying to solve everything at once.
  
  Experienced developers do the opposite:
  they break problems into pieces they already know how to solve.

  ## Think Before You Code
  
  Before writing code, ask:
  - What is the input?
  - What is the output?
  - What steps connect them?
  
  You can answer these questions in plain language.
  
  Code comes *after* understanding.

  ## A Simple Decomposition Example
  
  Goal:
  > Add all numbers in a list.
  
  Steps:
  1. Start with a total of 0
  2. Loop through each number
  3. Add the number to the total
  4. Return the total
  
  That’s the program.
  
  The code just follows the plan.

  ## Why This Skill Matters
  
  Problem decomposition is how you:
  - start projects without panic
  - avoid rewriting everything
  - debug complex behavior
  - scale from small scripts to real systems
  
  This is the skill that lets you build **without a tutorial open**.

  ## Your interactive challenge
  
  You will be given a goal.
  No step-by-step instructions.
  No hidden tricks.
  
  Your job is to:
  - think through the problem
  - break it into steps
  - implement the solution
  
  This is the final step in Stage 2.
