## Your First Python Program

This is the moment things become real.

You are no longer installing tools.
You are no longer checking versions.

You are writing a program.

It will be small.
It will be simple.

And it will work.

---

## Create a Project (Using VS Code)

Developers don’t create random files.

They create projects.

Let’s do this properly.

---

### Step 1 — Open VS Code

Open VS Code.

Make sure the **Explorer panel** is visible on the left.

If you don’t see it, click the top icon in the sidebar.

---

### Step 2 — Create a New Folder

Inside your workspace:

1. Click the **New Folder** icon  
2. Name the folder: \`hello-world\`  
3. Press Enter  

You just created your first project folder.

That matters.

---

### Step 3 — Create a Python File

Click on the **hello-world** folder to select it.

Then:

1. Click the **New File** icon  
2. Name the file: \`hello.py\`  
3. Press Enter  

The \`.py\` extension tells your system:

“This file contains Python code.”

You now have a real project structure.

---

## Write Your First Line of Code

Inside \`hello.py\`, type this on the first line:

\`\`\`python
print("Hello, world!")
\`\`\`

Save the file.

That single line is your first program.

---

## What Is This Line Doing?

Let’s break it down.

- \`print\` is a built-in Python function  
- The parentheses \`()\` tell Python to run the function  
- The text inside quotes is called a **string**  
- Strings represent text  

When Python reads this file,
it sees an instruction:

Display this text.

That’s programming.

---

## Running the Program

Now let’s execute it.

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.

You can do this by:

- Clicking **View → Terminal**
- Or using the shortcut:
  - Mac: \`Ctrl + \`\`
  - Windows: \`Ctrl + \`\`

Once the terminal is open,
make sure you are inside the **hello-world** folder.

If you are not, type:

\`\`\`bash
cd hello-world
\`\`\`

Press Enter.

---

## Run the File

Now type:

\`\`\`bash
python hello.py
\`\`\`

If that doesn’t work, try:

\`\`\`bash
python3 hello.py
\`\`\`

Press Enter.

---

## What You Should See

Your terminal should display:

\`\`\`
Hello, world!
\`\`\`

That output came from your code.

You wrote instructions.
Python executed them.
Your computer responded.

---

## Try Changing It

Modify the text:

\`\`\`python
print("I am learning Python.")
\`\`\`

Save.
Run it again.

Notice the output changes.

Because you changed the instructions.

You are in control.

---

## Why This Matters

This program is small.

But it proves something important:

- You can create a file  
- You can write instructions  
- You can execute them  
- The machine responds  

Every website.
Every automation tool.
Every game.
Every AI system.

Starts like this.

One instruction at a time.

## What Comes Next

Now that you can write and run Python code,
we begin understanding how data is stored.
