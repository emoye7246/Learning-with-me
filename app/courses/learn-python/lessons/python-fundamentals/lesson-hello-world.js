  ## Your First Python Program
  
  This is the moment where things become real.
  
  You are no longer installing tools.
  You are no longer verifying versions.
  
  You are writing a program.
  
  It will be small.
  It will be simple.
  
  And it will work.

  ## Create a Project (Using VS Code)
  
  Developers don’t create random files.
  They create projects.
  
  Let’s do it properly.
  
  ### Step 1 — Open VS Code
  
  Open VS Code.
  
  Make sure the **Explorer panel** is visible on the left.
  (If you don’t see it, click the top icon in the sidebar.)
  
  
  ### Step 2 — Create a New Folder
  
  Inside your workspace:
  
  1. Click the **New Folder** icon.
  2. Name the folder: \`hello-world\`
  
  Press Enter.
  
  Congratulations! You just created your first project folder.
  
  
  ### Step 3 — Create a Python File
  
  Click on the **hello-world** folder to select it.
  
  Then:
  
  1. Click the **New File** icon.
  2. Name the file: \`hello.py\`
  
  Press Enter.
  
  The \`.py\` extension tells your system:
  “This file contains Python code.”
  
  Congratulations! You now have a real project structure.

 ## Write Your First Line of Code !

Inside \`hello.py\`, you are going to write your first **line of code** (no turning back now !).

A *line of code* is exactly what it sounds like:
a single instruction written on one line that the computer can execute.

On the very first line of your file, type:

\`\`\`python
print("Hello, world!")
\`\`\`

Then save the file.

That single line of code is your entire first program.

  
  ---
## Run the Program

Open the integrated terminal inside VS Code.

There are multiple ways to do this:

- Use the shortcut: **Ctrl + \`** (Control + backtick)  
  (On macOS: **Cmd + \`**)

or

- Click **View → Terminal** from the top menu

or

- Click the **Terminal** tab at the bottom if it’s already visible

However you open it doesn’t matter.

Just get that terminal open.

---

## Make Sure You’re in the Right Folder

Look at the terminal prompt.

You should see that you are inside the **hello-world** folder.

If you are not, use:

\`\`\`bash
cd hello-world
\`\`\`

Press Enter.

Now you’re in the correct location.

---

## Run the File

Type:

\`\`\`bash
python hello.py
\`\`\`

If that does not work, try:

\`\`\`bash
python3 hello.py
\`\`\`

Press Enter.

  ## What You Should See
  
  The terminal should display:
  
  \`\`\`
  Hello, world!
  \`\`\`
  
  That text came from your program.
  
  You wrote instructions.
  Python executed them.
  Your computer responded.
  
  ---
  
  ## What Just Happened?
  
  Let’s break it down.
  
  - \`print\` is a built-in Python function.
    It tells Python to display something.
  
  - The parentheses \`()\` mean:
    “Run this function.”
  
  - The text inside quotes:
    \`"Hello, world!"\`
    is a string — a piece of text.
  
  When Python runs this file,
  it reads the line
  and executes the instruction.
  
  That is programming.
  
  ---
  
  ## Try Changing It
  
  Modify the text inside the quotes:
  
  \`\`\`python
  print("I am learning Python.")
  \`\`\`
  
  Save.
  Run the file again.
  
  Notice what changed.
  
  The output changes because your instructions changed.
  
  You are in control.
  
  ---
  
  ## Why This Matters
  
  This program is simple.
  
  But it proves something important:
  
  - You can create a file.
  - You can write instructions.
  - You can execute them.
  - The machine obeys.
  
  Every complex system —
  every website,
  every automation tool,
  every AI system —
  
  starts with instructions like this.
  
  You are building correctly.

  ## What Comes Next
  
  Now that you’ve written and run your first program,
  we begin understanding what data is
  and how Python stores it.
