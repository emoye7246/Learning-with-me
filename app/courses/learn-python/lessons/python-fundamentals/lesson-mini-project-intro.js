  ## Read This Before Starting
  
  The next section of this course is different.
  
  Up until now,
  you’ve been guided step-by-step.
  
  Now,
  you build.
  
  These mini-projects are not copy-and-paste lessons.
  
  They are challenges.
  
  And that’s intentional.

  ## Why This Matters
  
  Programming is not memorizing syntax.
  
  It is problem solving.
  
  In real life:
  
  - No one hands you the full solution.
  - No one writes your logic for you.
  - You are given a goal.
  - You figure it out.
  
  That’s what you’re about to practice.

  ## How These Mini-Projects Are Structured
  
  Each project will give you:
  
  - A clear goal
  - A checklist of required features
  - Testing requirements
  - Optional upgrades
  
  What you will NOT get:
  
  - The full solution
  - The exact code to copy
  - Every step spelled out
  
  You already learned the tools.
  
  Now you use them.

  ## What You Should Do When You Get Stuck
  
  This is important.
  
  When you hit a wall:
  
  1. Revisit previous lessons.
  2. Review your notes.
  3. Break the problem into smaller pieces.
  4. Use Google.
  5. Read error messages carefully.
  6. Ask for hints — not answers.
  
  Searching is part of programming.
  
  Debugging is part of programming.
  
  Struggling a little is part of programming.

  ## The Right Mindset
  
  You are not expected to solve everything instantly.
  
  You are expected to think.
  
  If something feels challenging,
  that means you are growing.
  
  Do not skip the challenge.
  
  Do not immediately look for the solution.
  
  Give yourself time to wrestle with it.
  
  That’s where real understanding happens.

  ## How to Approach Each Project
  
  Use this process:
  
  - Step 1: Write a simple version first.
  - Step 2: Make it work.
  - Step 3: Improve it.
  - Step 4: Add upgrades only after the core works.
  
  Build in layers.
  
  That’s how professionals build software.

  ## Important Rule
  
  If your program:
  
  - Runs without crashing
  - Follows the checklist
  - Produces the correct behavior
  
  Then it is correct.
  
  There is no single “perfect” solution.
  
  There are many correct solutions.

  ## What You’re About to Prove
  
  If you complete these mini-projects on your own,
  you are proving that you can:
  
  - Combine concepts
  - Think logically
  - Debug problems
  - Build complete programs
  
  That is the shift from beginner
  to real programmer.

  ## Now Begin
  
  Start with:
  
  **Mini-Project: Number Guessing Game**
  
  Take your time.
  
  Think.
  
  Build.
  
  You’re ready.
