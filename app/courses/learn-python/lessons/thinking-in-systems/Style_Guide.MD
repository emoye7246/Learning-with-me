# Course 3 — Content Style Guide

## Course Theme

Course 3 is called:

**Thinking in Systems (Advanced Fundamentals)**

The purpose is to shift learners from:

"I can write Python"

to

"I understand what my code is doing."

This course focuses on reasoning, clarity, and confidence.

Not syntax memorization.

---

## Tone

The tone must be:

- Calm
- Direct
- Confident
- Encouraging
- Minimal fluff
- No hype
- No emojis
- No AI mentions

Short paragraphs.

Lots of whitespace.

Clear section breaks.

Speak to the learner directly using "you".

---

## Structure (Required For Every Lesson)

Each lesson must follow this structure:

1. Title
2. Introduction (why this matters)
3. Mental Model (concept explanation)
4. Small Code Examples (2–4 max)
5. Common Mistakes
6. Practice Prompts (no full solutions)
7. Reflection Questions
8. What This Unlocks (how it builds confidence)
9. Next Lesson teaser

Do not skip sections.

Consistency builds trust.

## Formatting Rules

- Use Markdown headings (`##`, `###`)
- Keep paragraphs short (1–3 lines)
- Avoid long code blocks
- Code examples should be small and focused
- No massive multi-function programs
- Emphasize reasoning over typing

---

## Teaching Philosophy

This course is about:

- Tracing logic
- Observing state changes
- Reading code before writing code
- Debugging calmly
- Thinking before typing

Do not give full solutions to practice prompts.

Give:

- Hints
- Framing questions
- Checklist thinking

Learners should struggle slightly.

But not feel lost.

---

## What This Course Is NOT

- Not a syntax dump
- Not a project-heavy section
- Not a copy-and-paste tutorial

It is mental training.

---

## Code Example Rules

Code examples must:

- Be minimal
- Demonstrate one idea at a time
- Be readable
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Focus on behavior, not cleverness

---

## End Every Lesson With

A short reinforcement section:

"What you can now do"

Tie it back to confidence.

---

## Outcome Alignment

Every lesson must support at least one of these:

- Debug without panic
- Reason about code behavior
- Handle ambiguity
- Think before typing

Make this subtle, not explicit.

---

## Voice Reminder

You are guiding someone who:

- Knows the basics
- Is capable
- Just needs clarity

Respect their intelligence.

Challenge them calmly.

Build trust through structure.
