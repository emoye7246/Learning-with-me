  ## Where Python Code Lives
  
  One of the most confusing things for beginners is this question:
  
  **“Where does Python actually run?”**
  
  The answer is simpler than it sounds.
  
  Python code can be written and executed in many different environments,
  but the **language itself never changes**.
  
  Only the workspace does.

  ## Writing Python in This App
  
  In this app, you can write and run Python directly in the browser.
  
  This environment is designed for:
  - Learning
  - Experimenting
  - Practicing concepts
  - Solving challenges
  
  There is no setup required.
  You don’t need to install anything.
  You can focus entirely on understanding Python itself.
  
  This is one of the fastest ways to learn.

  ## Writing Python on Your Own Computer
  
  Outside of this app, Python is usually written on your local machine.
  
  This is done using tools called **IDEs**.
  
  An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is simply a workspace that helps you:
  - Write code
  - Run programs
  - Organize files
  - See errors clearly
  
  The IDE does not change Python.
  It only makes working with it more convenient.
  
  Popular Python IDEs include:
  - VS Code
  - PyCharm
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  
  Different tools.
  Same language.
  Same rules.

  ## What an IDE Is (and Isn’t)
  
  An IDE is **not** required to learn Python.
  It is **not** a separate version of the language.
  It does not make your code smarter.
  
  An IDE exists to:
  - Reduce friction
  - Catch simple mistakes
  - Help you navigate projects
  
  Think of it as a workbench.
  The quality of the work still comes from you.

  ## One Language, Many Environments
  
  Whether you write Python:
  - In this app
  - In an IDE on your computer
  - On a server
  - Inside an automation script
  
  The same core ideas apply.
  
  Python code is just instructions.
  The environment is just where those instructions are written and executed.
  
  Once you understand this,
  moving between tools becomes easy.

  ## What’s Next
  
  Now that you know where Python code lives,
  the next step is to understand **how it actually runs**.
  
  In the next article, we’ll explore how Python reads and executes code line by line,
  and what it really means to “run” a program.
