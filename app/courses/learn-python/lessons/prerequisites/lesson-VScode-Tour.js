## VS Code Tour

Welcome to your development environment.

This is where real programming begins.

When VS Code opens for the first time, it may look overwhelming.
Panels. Icons. Buttons. Menus.

That’s normal.

You’re not supposed to understand everything yet.
You’re just getting familiar with the space.

This lesson is a guided tour.
No pressure. No challenge. Just orientation.

## The Main Areas of VS Code

VS Code is divided into a few important areas:

- The **Editor**
- The **Explorer**
- The **Sidebar**
- The **Integrated Terminal**
- The **Top Menu**

You will use all of these regularly.
For now, we’ll identify them and explain what they do.

---

## The Editor (Center Area)

The large blank space in the center is called the **Editor**.

This is where:
- you write code
- you edit files
- you read programs

When you open or create a file, it appears here.

Right now, it may be empty.
That’s normal.

---

## The Explorer (Left Panel)

On the left side of the screen, you’ll see a panel.
This is called the **Explorer**.

The Explorer shows:
- folders
- files
- your project structure

If nothing is open yet, it may look empty.

Later, when you create Python files, they will appear here.

---

## The Sidebar Icons

Along the far left side, you’ll see a vertical row of icons.

These icons switch between different views:
- Explorer
- Search
- Source Control
- Extensions

For now, you only need to recognize the **Explorer icon**.
It usually looks like two stacked files.

---

## The Integrated Terminal

VS Code includes something called an **Integrated Terminal**.

This allows you to:
- run commands
- execute Python files
- interact with your system

It works the same way as the terminal you used earlier.

You can open it from the top menu:
View → Terminal

When opened, it appears at the bottom of the screen.

---

## The Top Menu

At the top of the window, you’ll see menu options like:

- File
- Edit
- View
- Run
- Terminal
- Help

You do not need to memorize these.
Just know that most actions can be found here.

---

## You Are Not Expected to Understand Everything

VS Code may look complex.

That’s normal.

Professional tools often look busy at first.
Over time, most of what you see will become familiar.

Right now, your only goal is recognition — not mastery.


---

## Pause and Confirm

Before moving on:
- Make sure VS Code opens successfully
- Identify the Editor area
- Locate the Explorer panel
- Open the Integrated Terminal once

If you can do those things, this lesson is complete.

---

## What Comes Next

Now that you understand the layout of VS Code,
it’s time to create your first Python file.

In the next lesson, you’ll:
- create a folder
- create a \`.\.py\` file
- run your first Python program locally

When you’re ready, continue to:
