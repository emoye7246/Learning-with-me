## Installing VS Code

Now that Python is installed and verified, the next step is to install a code editor.

A code editor is where you will:
- write Python files
- read code clearly
- run and manage your projects

For this course, we will use **Visual Studio Code**, commonly called **VS Code**.

--- 

## What VS Code Is (and Is Not)

VS Code is a **code editor**.

It is not:
- a programming language
- a replacement for Python
- something that runs code by itself

VS Code helps you work with code.
Python is what actually runs your programs.

Think of it this way:
- Python is the engine
- VS Code is the workspace

---

## Why We Use VS Code

VS Code is used by:
- beginners learning to code
- professional developers
- teams building real-world software

We use it in this course because it is:
- free
- widely supported
- available on all major operating systems
- flexible without being overwhelming

You are not locking yourself into anything permanent.
Skills you learn here transfer to other editors later.

## Download VS Code

VS Code should always be downloaded from the official website:

https://code.visualstudio.com

Once there:
1. Click **Download**
2. Choose the version for your operating system
3. Run the installer

---

## Installing VS Code by Operating System

### Windows

- Run the installer you downloaded
- Follow the default installation steps
- You can accept the recommended options

Once installed, VS Code will appear in your Start Menu.

---

### macOS

- Open the downloaded \`.dmg\` or installer file
- Drag **Visual Studio Code** into the **Applications** folder

VS Code is now installed like any other macOS application.

---

### Linux

Most Linux distributions provide VS Code as a package.

You can download it directly from:
https://code.visualstudio.com

Follow the installation instructions for your distribution.
If you prefer, you can also install it through your system’s package manager.


---

## Opening VS Code

After installation, open VS Code like any other application.

- On Windows, search for **Visual Studio Code**
- On macOS, open it from **Applications**
- On Linux, open it from your applications menu

When VS Code opens for the first time, you should see:
- a welcome screen
- an empty workspace
- menus along the top
- panels on the sides

You do not need to understand anything yet.
Just make sure it opens.


--- 

## You Cannot “Break” Anything Here

Installing VS Code does **not**:
- change your system settings
- modify Python
- affect existing files
- lock you into one workflow

If you ever stop using VS Code, you can uninstall it like any other app.

Nothing you do in this lesson is permanent or risky.

---

## Pause and Confirm

Before moving on:
- make sure VS Code is installed
- make sure it opens successfully
- don’t worry about configuring anything yet

If VS Code opens, this lesson is complete.

---

## What Comes Next

Now that VS Code is installed, the next step is to understand its interface.

In the next lesson, you’ll take a guided tour of VS Code:
- the editor
- the file explorer
- the integrated terminal

When you’re ready, continue to:
