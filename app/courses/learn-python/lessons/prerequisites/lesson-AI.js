## Read This Before Moving Forward

AI is powerful.

You will use it in your career.
Most developers already do.

But there is a difference between:

Using AI as a tool
and
Using AI as a crutch

If you rely on it too early,
you weaken the very skill you are trying to build.

Programming is not about memorizing answers.

It is about developing reasoning.

## The Hidden Risk of Overusing AI

If you ask AI for the solution the moment you feel stuck:

- You avoid struggling through the problem
- You skip developing debugging skills
- You weaken your ability to think step-by-step
- You build dependency instead of confidence

That cost does not show up immediately.

It shows up later —
when problems become complex
and AI suggestions are incomplete or wrong.

## The Right Way to Use AI

AI should help you grow —
not replace your thinking.

Before turning to AI, try this process:

1. Re-read the lesson carefully
2. Break the problem into smaller steps
3. Write pseudocode on paper
4. Search documentation
5. Test small pieces of the problem
6. Read the error message carefully

Only after attempting the problem should you seek help.

And when you do:

- Ask for a hint, not the full solution
- Ask for an explanation, not just code
- Make sure you understand why the solution works

Understanding is the goal.

---

## The Rule

AI should be:

- A clarifier
- A guide
- A reviewer

Not your first reflex.

If you copy solutions without understanding them,
you are not learning.

You are outsourcing growth.

And growth cannot be outsourced.

---

## Your Responsibility

Struggling is part of learning.

Confusion is part of learning.

Debugging is part of learning.

The discomfort you feel while solving a problem
is the signal that your skill is increasing.

Do not run from it.

Use AI wisely.
Use it intentionally.
Use it with discipline.

## What Comes Next

Now that you understand how to use AI as a tool rather than a crutch,
it's time to set up your Python projects properly.

In the next lesson, you'll learn about virtual environments —
how to keep each project's packages isolated so they never conflict with each other.
