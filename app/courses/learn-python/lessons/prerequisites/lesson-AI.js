## Use AI With Discipline

AI is powerful.

But early overreliance on it can quietly damage your growth as a developer.

If you ask AI to solve every problem the moment you feel stuck,
you train yourself to depend on answers instead of building reasoning.

Programming is not about knowing solutions.
It is about learning how to think.

When you skip the struggle:
- you weaken your problem-solving ability
- you avoid building debugging skills
- you delay developing intuition
- you become dependent instead of capable

That cost shows up later —
when problems become larger and AI answers are not enough.

## What To Do Instead

Before turning to AI:

- Re-read the lesson carefully  
- Try to solve the problem on paper  
- Break the problem into smaller pieces  
- Watch a focused tutorial  
- Collaborate with someone  
- Search official documentation  
- Ask a human mentor or peer  

Struggle first.
Think first.
Attempt first.

Then, if you still need help,
use AI carefully — and make sure you understand the explanation fully.

## The Rule

AI should be:

- a last resort  
- a clarifier  
- a reviewer  

Not your first reflex.

If you copy solutions without understanding them,
you are not learning.
You are outsourcing growth.

And growth cannot be outsourced.
