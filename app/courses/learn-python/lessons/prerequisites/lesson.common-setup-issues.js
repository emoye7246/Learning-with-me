## Common Setup Issues (and How to Stay Calm)

Before we move into writing real Python code,
let’s address something important:

Setup issues happen.

Even experienced developers run into them.
They are not a sign that you’re behind.
They are not a sign that you’re bad at this.
They are part of the process.

## The Most Common Problems

Here are the issues beginners usually encounter:

- Python installed, but \`python\` doesn’t work
- VS Code opens, but Python files don’t run
- The terminal says “command not found”
- The wrong version of Python appears
- The file cannot be located

None of these mean you failed.
They simply mean the system needs adjustment.

---

## Why These Problems Happen

Most setup issues come from one of three causes:

1. The system doesn’t know where Python is installed.
2. The terminal is in the wrong folder.
3. The wrong command is being used (\`python\` vs \`python3\`).

These are configuration details — not programming mistakes.

## A Simple Troubleshooting Pattern

If something doesn’t work, follow this pattern:

1. Slow down.
2. Read the full error message.
3. Check your current directory.
4. Confirm the file name.
5. Confirm the Python version.

Rushing creates more confusion.
Calm steps create clarity.

## What You Should Not Do

If something fails, avoid:

- randomly reinstalling everything
- copying commands from unknown sources
- editing system settings you don’t understand

Most issues are small and local.
Large reactions usually make them worse.


---

## When to Seek Help

If something truly feels stuck:

- Revisit the previous lesson slowly.
- Compare your commands carefully.
- Use the official documentation.
- Ask for help with the exact error message.

Developers don’t guess.
They investigate.

## You Have Built a Real Development Environment

Pause for a moment.

You:
- Installed Python
- Verified it
- Installed VS Code
- Learned how to use the terminal
- Navigated your system

That is not small.

You now have a working development environment.


---

## Course 1 Complete

You are no longer in setup mode.

You understand:
- where Python runs
- how your terminal works
- how your editor works
- how your system is structured

The foundation is solid.

Now we move forward.

## What Comes Next

In the next course, we begin writing real Python.

Not just running commands.
Not just installing tools.

Writing programs.

When you’re ready, continue to:
